    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project must include some elements of unsupervised learning, but you are welcome to include some supervised or other learning approaches as well.\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "# Abstract \n",
    "In the age of the Internet and streaming platforms such as Spotify, music has become widely accessible. However, even with the wide array of music we have been given access to, it can be easy to become confined within narrow music bubbles, limiting a user’s exposure to diverse sounds. Conventional recommendation systems, despite employing ML algorithms, often fall short in providing tailored suggestions that transcend traditional genre boundaries. We intend to implement our own unsupervised model using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to counter the aforementioned issues. We will supplement our model with a dataset of tens of thousands of songs and their corresponding features, which include variables such as the key the song is in, the genre, and elements such as valence, BPM, and danceability. Utilizing GMM for this dataset will create n-dimensional clusterings to represent relationships between songs, with an emphasis on soft, flexible clusterings that will suitably reflect the multifaceted nature of music. The success of our recommendations will be based on our model’s confidence that a user’s listening profile is similar to the model’s recommendations."

    "\n",
    "We’ll be using the Spotify Tracks Dataset found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset?resource=download). There are 114000 observations and 21 variables. Each observation is a song in Spotify and consists of an index in the dataset, the Spotify track ID, the artist(s) who wrote it, the name of the album that the song comes from, the name of the track, its popularity, the duration, if it’s explicit, its danceability, how energetic it is, what key it’s in, how loud it is in decibels, the mode (major or minor), its speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, the probability of the track being a live recording, the valence, tempo, time signature, and genre.\n", 
    "\n",
    "We’ll preprocess the data by removing any incomplete or repeat observations. We’ll also remove the explicitness, duration, popularity, and liveness variables since they aren’t particularly critical. Any observations where no key is detected (key = -1) and where speechiness is above 0.65 (predicted to be exclusively speech) will be removed from the dataset and we’ll also make adjustments to the genre classifications. All variables with the dataype 'object' will be type cast into strings. Songs that are labeled as 'acoustic', 'songwriter', 'singer-songwriter', 'happy' and 'sad' will be removed, songs labeled as 'electro' will be relabeled as 'electronic', and songs labeled as 'latino' will be relabeled as 'latin'.\n", 
    "\n",
    "The remaining critical variables are track_id (string), artists (string), album_name (string), track_name (string), danceability (float of 0.0 to 1.0 that describes how “danceable” a song is based on combination of musical elements), energy (float), key (int that maps to pitches using Pitch Class notation), loudness (float), mode (int where 0 is minor and 1 is major), speechiness (float where <= 0.33 is probably exclusively music and between 0.33 and 0.65 is a mix like rap), instrumentalness (float where the closer the value is to 1, the less vocal content), valence (float where high valence is more positive sentiment and low valence is more negative sentiment), tempo (float that represents BPM), time_signature (int from 3 to 7 that represents the beats per measure), and track_genre (string)."
