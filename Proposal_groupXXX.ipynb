    "# Abstract \n",
    "In the age of the Internet and streaming platforms such as Spotify, music has become widely accessible. However, even with the wide array of music we have been given access to, it can be easy to become confined within narrow music bubbles, limiting a user’s exposure to diverse sounds. Conventional recommendation systems, despite employing ML algorithms, often fall short in providing tailored suggestions that transcend traditional genre boundaries. We intend to implement our own unsupervised model using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to counter the aforementioned issues. We will supplement our model with a dataset of tens of thousands of songs and their corresponding features, which include variables such as the key the song is in, the genre, and elements such as valence, BPM, and danceability. Utilizing GMM for this dataset will create n-dimensional clusterings to represent relationships between songs, with an emphasis on soft, flexible clusterings that will suitably reflect the multifaceted nature of music. The success of our recommendations will be based on our model’s confidence that a user’s listening profile is similar to the model’s recommendations."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of digital music services, users often encounter difficulty in discovering new songs that align with their individual preferences. With a vast number of options and diverse selection of tracks available to listen to, this is not a simple task for people with complex preferences. This project aims to refine the process of music recommendation by developing a system capable of accurately predicting and suggesting songs that users are likely to enjoy, based on a quantifiable profile of their musical preferences.\n", 
    "\n",
    "This profile is constructed using measurable attributes of songs they have previously listened to and favored, including but not limited to danceability, energy, loudness, liveness, and genre. The core of the problem lies in effectively grouping songs using these attributes, for which we propose the application of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). By clustering the dataset of songs with GMM based on the mentioned metrics, we can then match a user's profile against these clusters to recommend new songs that share characteristics with those the user has shown a preference for.\n", 
    "\n",
    "The effectiveness of our recommendation system will be measured using precision and recall metrics, evaluating the system’s ability to identify songs that meet the user's taste while minimizing irrelevant suggestions.The effectiveness of our recommendation system will be measured using precision and recall metrics, evaluating the system’s ability to identify songs that meet the user's taste while minimizing irrelevant suggestions. This problem is both quantifiable, through the use of audio feature metrics, and replicable, as users consistently seek new music that fits their established preferences."

    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll be using the Spotify Tracks Dataset found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset?resource=download). There are 114000 observations and 21 variables. Each observation is a song in Spotify and consists of an index in the dataset, the Spotify track ID, the artist(s) who wrote it, the name of the album that the song comes from, the name of the track, its popularity, the duration, if it’s explicit, its danceability, how energetic it is, what key it’s in, how loud it is in decibels, the mode (major or minor), its speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, the probability of the track being a live recording, the valence, tempo, time signature, and genre.\n", 
    "\n",
    "We’ll preprocess the data by removing any incomplete or repeat observations. We’ll also remove the explicitness, duration, popularity, and liveness variables since they aren’t particularly critical. Any observations where no key is detected (key = -1) and where speechiness is above 0.65 (predicted to be exclusively speech) will be removed from the dataset and we’ll also make adjustments to the genre classifications. All variables with the dataype 'object' will be type cast into strings. Songs that are labeled as 'acoustic', 'songwriter', 'singer-songwriter', 'happy' and 'sad' will be removed, songs labeled as 'electro' will be relabeled as 'electronic', and songs labeled as 'latino' will be relabeled as 'latin'.\n", 
    "\n",
    "The remaining critical variables are track_id (string), artists (string), album_name (string), track_name (string), danceability (float of 0.0 to 1.0 that describes how “danceable” a song is based on combination of musical elements), energy (float), key (int that maps to pitches using Pitch Class notation), loudness (float), mode (int where 0 is minor and 1 is major), speechiness (float where <= 0.33 is probably exclusively music and between 0.33 and 0.65 is a mix like rap), instrumentalness (float where the closer the value is to 1, the less vocal content), valence (float where high valence is more positive sentiment and low valence is more negative sentiment), tempo (float that represents BPM), time_signature (int from 3 to 7 that represents the beats per measure), and track_genre (string)."

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "In motivation to implement accurate user music preference prediction into a music recommendation system, we will classify potential suggestions by degree of similarity with song features such as energy, tempo, valence, danceability, genre, and related artists with respect to the user’s music preference patterns over time. We will classify over 70,000 different songs into specific groups of songs with related measurable features by applying the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to cluster the data. GMM is the model of choice due to its better performance than k-means on large datasets and no specific requirements of data size or shape. From there, we will compare the representation of the user’s music preference (or the current song of choice user is listening to) along with the clustered representations of the spotify tracks dataset in vector space. Whichever cluster is closest in vector space to the user’s music will be denoted as the nearest neighbor or as the most likely related type of music the user will prefer to see in the music recommendation system. Confidence scores of the euclidean distance or the cosine similarity with a >= 0.7 threshold will be utilized to assess if  particular types of songs are a good fit to be recommended to the user."

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "We intend to use confidence as the evaluation metric to quantify the certainty of our model’s recommendation. There are a few attributes of our model’s clustering choices, as well as the feature space they occupy, that we can base our confidence scores on. For example, one approach for the derivation of confidence that we are interested in is the distance between the user-inputted song and its nearest neighbor (which would serve as our output, or the recommended song to the user). If these songs are very close in feature space, it would suggest a higher level of confidence in the recommendation, which should translate into a higher confidence score. This score, which would be a function of distance, could be quantified in a myriad of ways, such as Euclidean distance or cosine similarity. In application, we intend to employ the Python library FRONNI to generate confidence interval breakdowns to determine if our performance is acceptable. If the confidence score is >= 0.7, we’re considering the classification a success."
